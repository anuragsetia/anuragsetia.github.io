#### State wise death rate {.has-text-align-center}

This bar chart is to monitor the COVID19 death rate state wise. This indicates which states have higher fatalities relatively. This can be an indicator of the virus variant prevalent in that region which can further be correlated to the source country of transmission in that region. This can also be an indicator of the efficacy of health infrastructure.
