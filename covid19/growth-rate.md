  This depicts the 5-day moving average of the daily growth rate for both total confirmed and total active cases. Choice of 5-day moving average because daily growth rate has a tendency of fluctuating with events of transmission therefore, can throw up a wrong trend in short term, at least for prediction purposes whereas a moving average neutralizes the effect to quite an extend.
