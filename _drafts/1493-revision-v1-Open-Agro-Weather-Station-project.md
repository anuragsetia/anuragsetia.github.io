I have been conceptualizing an Open project to allow people to crowd fund weather stations for villages, to provide local weather information to farmers around the village. This intends to facilitate gathering spatially high-resolution or high density weather information therefore, allowing modelling of better local weather prediction models. This can become a weather data platform which can be leveraged by public and private enterprise for various use cases. A key use case of this, as the title suggests is agriculture - I cannot think of an industry in India whether weather is any more important than it is in agriculture.
