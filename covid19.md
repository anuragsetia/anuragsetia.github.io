This is a dashboard for monitoring progress of COVID19 in India. Use the buttons below to access various available charts.

## Total active cases trend

This chart depicts the progression of total confirmed cases and total active cases in India over the last 45 days. This is the key one we need to monitor and hope to see the Total Active curve to bend down soon enough.

## Daily new cases & recoveries

This depicts the trend of daily new cases being reported and daily recoveries across India. There are two key purposes for this chart –

  1. Monitor whether recoveries are catching up with the new cases therefore, indicating when will we see a drop in active cases
  2. Monitor whether we are getting less or more cases every passing day – an indicator or the transmission continuing or coming under control
