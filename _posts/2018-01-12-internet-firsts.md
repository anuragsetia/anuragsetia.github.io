Cleaning email archives over the weekend, came across emails from my first email account on usa.net in 2000 &#8211; the first time I got access to internet (though I had access to a PC since 1993 I believe &#8211; MS DOS, no HDD). Took me back to exploring my firsts on internet and here is list of what I can recall &#8211;

|Service          	|First Used                       	|
|-                	|-                                	|
|Email Account    	|usa.net (@netaddress.com) (2000) 	|
|Chat service		| Yahoo Chat (2001)					|
|Search / Directory service | Yahoo Directory (2001)	|
| Blogging			| Blogspot (2004-05)				|
|  Streaming (audio)| Yahoo Launchcast (2004)			|
| Streaming (video) | YouTube (?)						|
| Internet Banking	| ICICI (2004)						|
| Online Shopping	| deals2buy.com (2004)				|


Will add if I recall any others.
