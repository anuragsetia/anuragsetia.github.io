How about a service which captures the actions out of a meeting in your stead.

Say introduces a bot which you can invite to any of your meetings. When the meeting starts, it listens to the entirety of the meeting, identifying voices apart from one another, captures whenever an action is called out along with the action owner and due date and sends out the summary of those actions back to you after the meeting is over.

To guide it for perfect usage when communicating across languages in a meeting, it can also have voice commands which can prompt such an entry.<amp-fit-text layout="fixed-height" min-font-size="6" max-font-size="72" height="80">

  Might fit it perfectly with an enterprise-targeted smart speaker or web conferencing services out there. Any takers?
