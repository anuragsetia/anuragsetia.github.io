<span style="font-family:verdana;">I got atleast 10 people showing me the site <a href="http://www.airtel.com/">http://www.airtel.com/</a> and laughing off how Vodafone has taken over Airtel site&#8230;. and I pity everyone who&#8217;s thinking something like this without understanding what actually is behind all this.</span>  
<span style="font-family:verdana;"><br />First the domain name airtel.com doesnt belong to Bharti Tele Ventures Ltd, the Airtel service provider that we know in India. They have their site up at <a href="http://www.airtel.in/">http://www.airtel.in/</a> or at <a href="http://www.airtelworld.com/">http://www.airtelworld.com/</a></p> 

<p>
  Second, if your organization&#8217;s name is India, doesnt imply that you would surely get <a href="http://www.india.com/">http://www.india.com/</a> domain available.. if its taken u might try and negotiate to buy the domain from the existing owner but thats about it.
</p>

<p>
  Also, Airtel is a brand patented by Bharti only in India (to begin with) and can be used by any other organization anywhere else in the world and Vodafone has it in Spain&#8230;. so they got the site&#8217;s domain name registered long before our Airtel did.
</p>

<p>
  Airtel and Vodafone might seem competitive in India.. they are actually working as a joint venture in Jersey which I imagine is somewhere in UK.
</p>

<p>
  So I would really recommend all the forward freaks to get their facts straight before fwd junk and occupying valuable bandwidth.</span><br /></span>
