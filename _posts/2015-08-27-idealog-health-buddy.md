Here&#8217;s a thought.

A health service, where you could

  * seek secondary opinions when necessary from a doctor of your choice from the directory made up of top rated specialist from across the country and global perhaps,
  * seek a medical counselor to tag-long on doctor visits or the like and help you understand the whole deal i.e. the illness, treatment options, pros and cons etc in layman terms,
  * store your health records

There are plenty of ways to seek secondary opinions and a lot of people do that in today&#8217;s world since it allows them to vet the diagnosis and the treatment and let&#8217;s face it, the doctor-patient trust equation isn&#8217;t really what it used to be. It&#8217;s doable for people in the big cities however beyond that, it&#8217;s very difficult. Having your health records available electronically and having access to a doctor of your choosing electronically can however fix this.

How many of us have seen or experienced people, otherwise great at their day jobs, when into health issues especially involving a surgery seek counseling from a doctor or &#8220;wise&#8221; people in their circles. And by wise I mean people who&#8217;ve had prior experience of dealing with doctors and health issue in some form. This is usually sought as a favor. How about someone professional &#8211; a health professional with sufficient experience at your service to accompany you to the doctor on your visits or sit beside you on a doctor&#8217;s daily rounds and help you understand the choices you stand up against. You still have to make the decision, of course however, an enabler of making an informed well-understood decision.

All this would surely be riding on the infrastructure of electronic health records, a directory of health professionals, online appointments, recommendations basis yours and your family&#8217;s history.

Welcome any views on this.
