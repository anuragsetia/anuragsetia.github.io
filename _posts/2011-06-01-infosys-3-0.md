  <span style="font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">Read about Infosys starting a software products startup.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">What thrills me most about this is the fact that eventually they realized how important, though risky, it is to have something which can bring in recurring income.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">Hopefully, this would bring the culture of products in IT in India and hopefully, some big ones beyond business solutions.. may be a middleware or a big time Operating System someday.</span>
