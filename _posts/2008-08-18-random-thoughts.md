<span style="font-size:85%;">Heard earth is moving closer to sun all the time and would finally collapse in it. If thats the case, Venus must be moving closer to the position that Earth was in a few million or billion years back and may be able to support life pretty soon.. i mean a few thousand years. How about we immigrate to Venus, then.</span>
